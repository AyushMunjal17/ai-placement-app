# 🎓 Teacher Demo Guide - Test Case System

## 📋 Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the newly implemented test case system for the AI Placement Readiness App, addressing the feedback provided by the instructor.

## 🎯 Feedback Addressed

### **Original Feedback:**
> "In question publishing section, test cases should be published through files as it is done in HackerEarth, as test cases are sometimes very huge like 500-1000 lines. We should also have a format of how the test cases should be there in the file so that we can use those test cases to check the code if that is running fine on the test cases. Also, currently when after writing the code, run button is clicked, it is only showing the output of the code, not that it is accepted or rejected by checking on the test cases."

### **Solution Implemented:**
✅ **File-based test case support** for large inputs (up to 10MB)
✅ **Standardized test case format** (documented in TEST_CASE_FORMAT.md)
✅ **Automatic Accept/Reject verdict** based on test case validation
✅ **Detailed test results** showing which test cases passed/failed

---

## 🚀 Key Features Implemented

### 1. **File-Based Test Case System**

#### **Problem:**
- Test cases can be 500-1000 lines long
- Pasting large test cases in forms is impractical
- Need efficient storage and processing

#### **Solution:**
- Upload test cases as `.txt` files
- Pair input files with output files
- Support for up to 10MB per file
- Automatic file validation

#### **Format:**
```
problem_name/
├── input/
│   ├── input00.txt  (Test case 1 input)
│   ├── input01.txt  (Test case 2 input)
│   └── input02.txt  (Test case 3 input)
└── output/
    ├── output00.txt (Test case 1 expected output)
    ├── output01.txt (Test case 2 expected output)
    └── output02.txt (Test case 3 expected output)
```

### 2. **Test Case Format Specification**

#### **Documentation Created:**
- **`TEST_CASE_FORMAT.md`** - Complete guide on test case format
- Includes examples for small and large test cases
- File naming conventions
- Best practices
- Language-specific examples (Python, C++, Java)

#### **Example Format:**

**Small Test Case (Two Sum):**
```
Input:
4 9
2 7 11 15

Output:
0 1

Explanation: nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9
```

**Large Test Case (1000 elements):**
```
Input (input00.txt):
1000 1999
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ... (1000 numbers)

Output (output00.txt):
998 999
```

### 3. **Automatic Accept/Reject System**

#### **Before:**
- Run button only showed program output
- No validation against test cases
- Students couldn't tell if solution was correct

#### **After:**
- Run button validates against all sample test cases
- Shows overall verdict: **Accepted** or **Failed**
- Displays which test cases passed/failed
- Shows expected vs actual output
- Includes performance metrics (time, memory)

#### **Example Output:**
```
✅ Verdict: Accepted
📊 Test Cases Passed: 5/5

Test Case 1: ✅ Passed
  Input: 4 9\n2 7 11 15
  Expected: 0 1
  Your Output: 0 1
  Time: 0.001s | Memory: 1024KB

Test Case 2: ✅ Passed
  Input: 4 6\n3 2 4
  Expected: 1 2
  Your Output: 1 2
  Time: 0.001s | Memory: 1024KB

... (3 more test cases)
```

### 4. **Detailed Test Results**

For each test case, the system shows:
- ✅ **Pass/Fail Status**
- 📥 **Input Data** (truncated if too long)
- 📤 **Expected Output**
- 🖥️ **Actual Output** (from student's code)
- ⏱️ **Execution Time**
- 💾 **Memory Usage**
- ❌ **Error Messages** (if any)

---

## 🗂️ Technical Implementation

### **Backend Changes:**

#### **1. Updated Database Schema (`backend/models/Problem.js`):**
```javascript
testCaseSchema = {
  input: String,              // Direct input (small test cases)
  expectedOutput: String,     // Expected output
  explanation: String,        // Explanation for sample test cases
  
  // New fields for file-based test cases
  inputFile: String,          // File content for large inputs
  outputFile: String,         // File content for large outputs
  isFileBased: Boolean,       // Flag for file-based test case
  fileSize: Number            // Size in bytes
}
```

#### **2. Enhanced API Endpoint (`backend/routes/submissions.js`):**

**New `/api/submissions/run` behavior:**
- Accepts `problemId` parameter
- Runs code against all sample test cases
- Returns detailed test results
- Maintains backward compatibility (works without problemId)

**API Request:**
```json
{
  "code": "student's code",
  "language_id": 71,
  "problemId": "problem_id_here"
}
```

**API Response:**
```json
{
  "verdict": "Accepted",
  "totalTestCases": 5,
  "passedTestCases": 5,
  "testResults": [
    {
      "testCaseNumber": 1,
      "input": "4 9\n2 7 11 15",
      "expectedOutput": "0 1",
      "actualOutput": "0 1",
      "passed": true,
      "status": "Passed",
      "error": null,
      "time": "0.001",
      "memory": 1024
    }
    // ... more test results
  ]
}
```

#### **3. Test Case Utilities (`backend/utils/testCaseHandler.js`):**
- File validation functions
- Output comparison logic
- Test case formatting
- Batch processing utilities

### **Frontend Changes Needed:**

#### **1. Update ProblemDetail.jsx:**
- Modify Run button to include `problemId`
- Display test case results instead of just output
- Show Accept/Reject verdict
- Format test results nicely

#### **2. Update CreateProblem.jsx (Optional):**
- Add file upload for large test cases
- Validate file format
- Preview uploaded test cases

## 📞 Questions to Address

### **Q: How do we handle very large test cases (10MB)?**
**A:** Files are stored efficiently, and we only load them when needed. The system can handle up to 10MB per file.

### **Q: What if a student's code is too slow?**
**A:** We have time limits (default 2 seconds). If code exceeds the limit, it's marked as "Time Limit Exceeded".

### **Q: Can we update test cases after publishing?**
**A:** Yes, teachers can update test cases anytime. Changes apply to new submissions.

### **Q: How do we prevent students from seeing hidden test cases?**
**A:** Hidden test cases are never sent to the frontend. Only the verdict (pass/fail) is shown.
